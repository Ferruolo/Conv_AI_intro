Completeting this assignment helped me better understand the Jaseci
framework and gave me a better idea of how to implement
my final AI. Specifically, I learned how to easily implement models,
create graphs, and integrate two models together seamlessly using the
jaseci system. Although I do not think this is all I will
need to do for my AI, there is a lot of additional machine learning
outside of text API that needs to be completed, I believe that this will
prove to be a strong start.
